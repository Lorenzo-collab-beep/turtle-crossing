Turtle Crossing is an endless arcade game where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road. 
Each time the turtle makes it to the other side, a new level begins. 
Enemies spawn randomly with increasing speed and frequency, making every level unique and progressively harder. 
The goal is simple: survive as long as possible and beat your own high score.
